## About

This project, **chef-sbt**, is a Chef Cookbook for SBT that downloads the sbt-launch.jar file directly from scala-sbt.org, and
configures it in your path manually. This tends to be preferable if you, like me, have come to
grow impatient with waiting for package managers to update their versions or would prefer to
manually control when your boxes move to a different version.

I've only enumerated support for Ubuntu and Debian in this cookbook, but it may work elsewhere
as well. Haven't done a lot of testing yet.

### Attributes

The chef-sbt cookbook recognizes the following attributes.

* `node['sbt']['version']` - The version of the sbt launcher you would like to use. Currently, this defaults to 0.13.8, the latest stable, but can be any version available in the [typesafe download repo](http://repo.typesafe.com/typesafe/ivy-releases/org.scala-sbt/sbt-launch/).
* `node['sbt']['checksum']` - The SHA256 checksum of the file downloaded from Typesafe.com. (optional)
* `node['sbt']['java_options']` - The JVM flags that should be passed to the JVM when sbt starts. Currently, this is defaulted to `-Xms512M -Xmx1536M -Xss1M -XX:+CMSClassUnloadingEnabled -XX:MaxPermSize=512M`, and that works well for me... but YMMV.

### Recipes

* **default** - This recipe will download the sbt-launch.jar of the version you specify to `/usr/local/bin`, create an executable script `sbt` in that same folder, set permissions on them, and make them owned by root.
